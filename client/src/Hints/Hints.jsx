<p>The Lion and the Mouse
  
One day a lion was sleeping in a forest. A small mouse was playing nearby. It started playing on the body of the lion. This disturbed the lion's sleep, and he got angry. The lion threatened to kill the mouse by crushing it. The scared mouse asked forgiveness from the lion. Further, he promised he would save the lion one day. The lion started laughing. He wondered how such a small animal like a mouse could save a huge animal like a lion. But he let the mouse go off.
 
Some days later, the lion was caught in a hunter's net. The lion tried to free himself, but he could not. He started roaring in fear and sorrow. The mouse heard the lion's roar and came to his rescue. The mouse started biting the net with this teeth. Slowly the net opened up, and the lion escaped. The lion thanked the mouse with all his heart. He realized that no matter whether someone is big or small, anybody can help the other person in need anytime.</p>
