         <p className='mathspara'>Probability means possibility. It is a branch of mathematics that deals with the occurrence of a random event. The value is expressed from zero to one. Probability is a branch of study that describes how likely events are to occur.<br />There are three basic rules associated with probability: the addition, multiplication, and complement rules. The addition rule is used to calculate the probability of event A or event B happening; we express it as: P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)</p>
