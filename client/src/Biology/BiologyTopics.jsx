      <h1>Cells and Molecular Biology</h1>
      <br />
      <p>Cell and Molecular Biology encompasses study of the structure and function of organisms and biological processes at the level of cells, and the macromolecules that define them (DNA, RNA, proteins, lipids, and carbohydrates). Cell and Molecular Biology studies the structure and function of the cell, which is the basic unit of life. Cell biology is concerned with the physiological properties, metabolic processes, signaling pathways, life cycle, chemical composition and interactions of the cell with their environment. This is done both on a microscopic and molecular level as it encompasses prokaryotic cells and eukaryotic cells. Knowing the components of cells and how cells work is fundamental to all biological sciences; Research activities within the Cell and Molecular Biology section address various biological questions involving single cell as well as multicellular organisms and use a large range of different technologies.Cell biology is the study of cell structure and function, and it revolves around the concept that the cell is the fundamental unit of life.</p>
