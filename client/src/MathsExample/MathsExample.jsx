        <h1>Basic Arithmetic Operations</h1>
        <p>The four basic arithmetic operations in Maths, for all real numbers, are:</p>
        <li>Addition (Finding the Sum; ‘+’)</li>
        <li>Subtraction (Finding the difference;  ‘-’) </li>
        <li>Multiplication (Finding the product; ‘×’ ) </li>
        <li>Division (Finding the quotient; ‘÷’)</li>
        <br />
        <h2>Addition Definition</h2>
        <p>The addition is a mathematical process of adding things together. The addition process is denoted by ‘+’ sign. It involves combining two or more numbers into a single term. In addition process, the order does not matter. It means that the addition process is commutative. It can involve any type of number whether it be a real or complex number, fraction, or decimals.</p>
        <strong><p>Example: 4.13 + 3.87 = 8</p></strong>
        <p>The addition of more than two numbers, values or terms is also known as a summation of terms and can involve n number of values.</p>
        <br />
        <h2>Addition Rules</h2>
        <p>The following are the addition rules for integers:</p>
        <li>Addition of two positive integers is a positive integer</li>
        <li>Addition of two negative integers is a negative integer        </li>
        <li>While adding positive and negative integers, subtract the integers and use the sign of the largest integer number        </li>
        <br />
        <h2>Subtraction Definition        </h2>
        <p>The subtraction operation gives the difference between two numbers. Subtraction is denoted by ‘-‘ sign. It is almost similar to addition but is the conjugate of the second term. It is the inverse process of addition. The addition of the term with the negative term is known as subtraction. This process is mostly used to find how many are left when some things are taken away.</p>
        <strong><p>Example: 15 – 7</p></strong>
        <p>The term can also be re-written as 15 + (-7)<br />
        Adding terms we have, 8.</p>
        <br />
        <h2>Subtraction Rules        </h2>
        <p>The following are the subtraction rules for integers:</p>
        <li>If both the signs of the integers are positive, the answer will be the positive integer        </li>
        <li>If both the signs of the integers are negative, the answer will be the negative integer        </li>
        <li>If the signs of the integers are different, subtract the values, and take the sign from the largest integer value.        </li>
        <br />
        <h2>Multiplication Definition        </h2>
        <p>Multiplication is known as repeated addition. It is denoted by ‘×’ or ‘*’. It also combines with two or more values to result in a single value. The multiplication process involves multiplicand, multiplier. The result of the multiplication of multiplicand and the multiplier is called the product </p>
        <strong><p>Example:  2 × 3 = 6</p></strong>
        <p>Here, “2” is the multiplier, “3” is the multiplicand, and the result “6” is called the product.</p>
        <p>The product of two numbers says ‘a’ and ‘b’ results in a single value term ‘ab,‘ where a and b are the factors of the final value obtained.</p>
        <br />
        <h2>Multiplication Rules        </h2>
        <p>The following are the multiplication rules for integers:</p>
        <li>The product of two positive integers is a positive integer</li>
        <li>The product of two negative integers is a positive integer        </li>
        <li>The product of positive and negative integer is a negative integer</li>
